# ROT13 Cipher Decoder

## Unlock the Secrets of the Alphabet!

Welcome to the **ROT13 Cipher Decoder**, your trusty tool to unravel the mysteries hidden within encoded messages. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or just love puzzles, you've come to the right place!

## What is ROT13?

ROT13 is a simple yet fascinating cipher that shifts each letter by **13 places** in the alphabet. Itâ€™s a special case of the Caesar cipher and is often used for fun, puzzles, or hiding spoilers. A quick example:

- `A` â†” `N`
- `B` â†” `O`
- `C` â†” `P`
- ...
- `Z` â†” `M`

**Note:** All input is expected to be in uppercase, but the decoder is flexible with non-alphabetic characters like spaces, punctuation, and numbers â€” they stay the same!

## Our Magical Decoder Function

Here's the heart of our cipher decoder â€” a JavaScript function that takes an encoded message and reveals the original:

```javascript
function rot13(str) {
  return str.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function(char) {
    const code = char.charCodeAt(0);
    if (code >= 65 && code <= 90) {
      return String.fromCharCode(((code - 65 + 13) % 26) + 65);
    }
    return char; // Leave non-letters untouched
  });
}
``

## How to Use

Simply call the `rot13()` function with your message:

```javascript
console.log(rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC")); // Outputs: FREE CODE CAMP
``
